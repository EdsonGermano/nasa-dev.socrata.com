[Kettle](http://kettle.pentaho.com/) is a free and open source Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool made by [Pentaho](http://www.pentaho.com/). The tool is similar to [Safe FME](/connectors/safe-fme.html) in that it provides the means to extract and transform data from a variety of data sources such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, a variety of NoSQL, APIs, text files, etc.

Kettle can be used to automate the extraction, transformation, and publishing of data to update Socrata datasets by making use of the City of Chicago's [open source ETL toolkit](/publishers/examples/pentaho-kettle-etl-kit.html).
