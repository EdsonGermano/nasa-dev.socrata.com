A PHP library for working with the Socrata API. Provided as an alternative to Socrata's official implementation, this library takes more of an object-oriented approach to working with the API instead of manually creating requests and aims to fill some of the short-comings of the official library.

This library fully supports interacting with the API by getting datasets and handling tokens or authentication in order to write or modify datasets.
